	  be useful in
	  the future)

2007-08-31 10:03  blino

2007-06-23 13:54  pixel

	* lib/Youri/Submit/Action/Mail.pm, lib/Youri/Submit/Reject/Mail.pm:
	  keep raw changelogs to avoid changing the format (backport)

2007-06-23 08:10  spuk

	* lib/Youri/Submit/Check/Recency.pm: - check for newer and same
	  existing revisions in a single pass
	  - use proper get_revisions() instead of get_install_file() hack,
	  as the
	  latter will use the current file name, and thus will fail to
	  check for an
	  existing package revision when submitting, because submitted
	  SRPMs have a
	  different name ("@rev:foobar-...") than what goes into the
	  repository

2007-06-22 13:51  pixel

	* lib/Youri/Submit/Post/CleanRpmsrate.pm: ensure we don't do

	  MD5SUM

2007-06-22 13:35  pixel

	* lib/Youri/Submit/Post/Genhdlist2.pm: - need to redo global
	  MD5SUM. This MD5SUM is mostly obsolete, but is still needed up to
	  2007.1
	  (and needed even on cooker for existing urpmi.cfg)
	  - don't use --blind. hopefully not needed

	  - removed double $path from debug string

2007-03-15 12:36  mrl

	* lib/Youri/Submit/Check/Version.pm: - Fixed version_freeze mode:

	  restriction as option
	  authorized_users.

2007-03-15 12:32  mrl

2007-03-10 07:49  spuk

	* lib/Youri/Submit/Action/Archive.pm: The extra '/' was causing the
	  string to not be matched by the regexp below
	  for getting $rep_section and $rep_main_section, in the end making
	  the SRPMs
	  of all other subsections be removed when a newer package was
	  uploaded for any
